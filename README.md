## What is it?
The Adept Go is a travel friendly case mod for the Ploopy Adept. It is thin, light weight, and takes up very little space in your bag. There is both a standard and [adeptBLE](https://github.com/taichan1113/AdeptBLE) friendly variant.

this project started as a BLE revision of the [Small Mod](https://github.com/adept-anyball/ploopy-adept-small-btu) but quickly snowballed into it's own thing.

## Modular design & 100% 3D printed
The bowl is designed to be printed separately and can be swapped out without disassembling the whole body.

Each part can be printed without supports and the only additional hardware needed are the 4 assembly screws.

### Nano (34mm - 38mm)
the Nano variant is designed for a 34-38mm ball, similar to the actual Ploopy Nano. 

### Pico (20mm)
The Pico variant uses a 20mm ball. It has a uniquely lidded design, making it much easier to travel with.

### Other sizes
The bowl is simple enough to modify in CAD, and I've tested with a ball as large as 44mm, so feel free to make your own variants.

## Why no BTUs or Bearings?
Size and ease of assembly. BTUs would almost double the vertical height and I wanted something that required minimal additional hardware. 

That said, feel free to design another bowl with BTUs, static bearing, roller bearing, or whatever other hardware you prefer!
